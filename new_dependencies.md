## Pathos

    $ pip install pathos

Pathos, a python parallel processing library from caltech.

Unlike Python's default multiprocessing library, pathos provides a more flexible
parallel map which can apply almost any type of function --- including lambda
functions, nested functions, and class methods --- and can easily handle
functions with multiple arguments.

In authorâ€™s own words:

"Pathos is a framework for heterogenous computing.
It primarily provides the communication mechanisms for configuring
and launching parallel computations across heterogenous resources"

multiprocess.Pool is a fork of multiprocessing.Pool, with the only difference
being that multiprocessing uses pickle and multiprocess uses dill

The preferred interface is pathos.pools.ProcessPool

The pathos-wrapped pool is pathos.pools.ProcessPool (and the old interface
provides it at pathos.multiprocessing.Pool).

* Check that posterior != prior with KL div
* Prior as elfi
